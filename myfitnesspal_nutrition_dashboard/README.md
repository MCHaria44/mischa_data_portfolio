# MyFitnessPal Nutrition Dashboard

This project analyses over 4 weeks of personal nutrition data from MyFitnessPal. The goal was to explore trends in calorie and protein intake and measure consistency with dietary goals.

## Tools Used
- Google Sheets
- MyFitnessPal (manual exports)
- Basic spreadsheet formulas (COUNTIF, AVERAGEIF, charts)

## Features
- Weekly summaries of calories and protein intake
- KPI metrics for goal alignment (calories under 1900 kcal, protein over 110g)
- Interactive visuals tracking weekly trends and consistency

## Key Insights
- Identified which weeks had consistent logging
- Visualised trends in meeting protein and calorie goals
- Provided a base for future expansion into Power BI or Python

## Data Cleaning
- Removed units (g, mg) from MyFitnessPal exports
- Cleaned daily totals manually to ensure formula compatibility
- Added binary indicators (Y/N) for days logged
